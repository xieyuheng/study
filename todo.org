* cicada
- why we have value vs exp
  - in lambda
    for redux
  - in cicada
    for redux and unification
    why unification instead of substitution ?
    System Fω
- what is in a record that lambda can not express ?
- be sure about eval and apply on fn
- check
- [test] MemberTypeValue can be used as type, just by using `the`
- [problem] deep walk cost so much
- compile to js with runtime type information
  - this means keep Value serde-able
    - Value includes FnValue which contains Exp
      this Exp is also serde-able
* partech
- ExampleRule
- sexp example
- TreeTo
- parse error reporting
- [maybe] WordPred for error reporting
- linear time parser for all context free grammar with epsilon
- test partech by cicada syntax -- read file from lib/core
* set, type, cat
- what is the difference between set, type and cat ?
  - set: ==, member relation, subset relation
  - type: ==, member relation
  - cat: ==, |
* tartlet
- better expDSL
- better Module
- better tests
- the little typer as test
- how to extend tartlet to define new types?
* minitt

- Normal expressions and Readback
- Typing Rules
- better expDSL
