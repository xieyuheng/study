* proof of "not not (P or (not P))"

  not not (P or (not P))
  not not (P or (P -> contradictory))
  not not (P | P -> contradictory)
  not (P | P -> contradictory) -> contradictory
  ((P | P -> contradictory) -> contradictory) -> contradictory
  ((P | P -> contradictory) -> contradictory) -> P -> (P -> contradictory)
  ((P | P -> contradictory) -> contradictory) -> P ->       contradictory
  (P                        -> contradictory) -> P ->       contradictory

  but
  1. we do not want to use false -> (P -> false)
  2. "not not (P or (not P))" is not so meaningful
     because we can not just view "not A" as "A -> false"
     instead we need to know explicit what contradictory A implies (for example B and not B)
